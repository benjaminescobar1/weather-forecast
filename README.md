## Description

Weather forecast! This website is built to display the current and future weather forecast for the city searched. This page was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. A weather API is used to fetch the information the user requests for specific city. Once the city is searched then the date, temperature, humidity and wind speed information will be provided to the user. Along with the next 5-days forecast for that city. The current date is indicated with an orange circle so that the user knows it is the current day. Also the user can make another search for a different city and the previous city searched will be saved under the search history. Enjoy!
